What this basically means is that you took a bit longer than usual to checkout. This gives the opportunity to someone else to take your cart if they do it fast enough. Unfortunately we do not have control over this at this time. For future reference, once you have your desired items you have to be quick to check out. Otherwise you run the chance of getting “cart jacked”. <\/p>"}},"content_ixpJqL":{"type":"content","settings":{"question":"I FORGOT TO ADD MY PROMO CODE AT CHECKOUT, IS IT TOO LATE TO ADD?","answer":"<p>Unfortunately yes, we’re unable to add a promo in the system once an order is placed.

WILL THEY SHRINK?","answer":"<p>For the longest lasting results, drop them off at the dry cleaners. But for washing, the best way to care for your shirts is to turn them inside out and machine or hand wash them on cold in separates. Since all of the shirts have some percentage of cotton, they will tend to shrink a little after being washed and dried. For the least shrinkage, dry on low or hang dry.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["content_RbKptq","content_ixpJqL","content_P8NNEz","content_4eamA4","content_7PrBTG"],"settings":{"title":"Orders","title_size":"h2","title_color":"","layout":"heading-on-top","layout_mobile_align":"auto","dividing_line":"top","spacing_top":20,"spacing_bottom":40,"open_answer":false,"blocks_question_color":"","blocks_answer_color":""}},"faq_9rayDQ":{"type":"faq","blocks":{"content_zBRCLt":{"type":"content","settings":{"question":"WHAT IS YOUR RETURN POLICY?","answer":"<p>Unworn product can be returned\/exchanged within <strong>15 business days<\/strong> of delivery for store credit.
